# MySQL Challenge

This assignment explores the concepts of database normalization and management using a software project company scenario.

Scenario: Imagine a software development company managing projects for various clients. Each project has a team assigned, including a team lead.

Refer to [the shared documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tF9dUYFmnvmD2-hmAturgwDNt_5bwF88?usp=drive_link) for the normalized schema and query requirements. (You are free to extend the schema however you want)

### Tasks:

- Develop the database using MySQL (apply all the necessary table constraints and relationships)
- Populate the database based on the data provided in the shared documents.
- Develop Database Queries, Views, Functions, Procedures, and Triggers.

### Deliverables:

SQL scripts for the database, all queries, functions, views, and stored procedures.
Diagrams illustrating database schema and relationships.
